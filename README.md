# Tip Calculator in Python

This is a simple tip calculator program in Python that takes the bill amount, the percentage of tip (10, 12, 15), and the number of people to split the bill amongst, and calculates the total bill amount with tip.             

## Usage

To use the program, simply run the `tip_calculator.py` file in your Python environment. The program will prompt you to enter the bill amount, the percentage of tip, and the number of people to split the bill amongst. After you enter these values, the program will calculate the total bill amount with tip and display it to you. 

## Example          

Suppose you want to calculate the total bill amount with tip for a $100 bill, with a 15% tip and 2 people to split the bill amongst. Here's how you would do it:

1. Open the `tip_calculator.py` file in your Python environment.
2. Enter the bill amount: 100
3. Enter the percentage of tip: 15
4. Enter the number of people to split the bill amongst: 2
5. Press Enter to calculate the total bill amount with tip.
6. The program will display the total bill amount with tip: $125.00


## Note

This program assumes that the user enters valid input (i.e. a positive integer for the bill amount, a positive integer or decimal for the percentage of tip, and a positive integer for the number of people to split the bill amongst). 

I hope this program helps you in your Python journey!
